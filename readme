# 🧳 Story-Based Trip Generator (Frontend)

This is the **frontend** of the Story-Based Trip Generator project. It allows users to input a story prompt (e.g., "a romantic weekend getaway") and receive a personalized AI-generated itinerary. The user can then **download the itinerary as a PDF**.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **React** (for UI)
- **Vite** (for frontend development server and build)
- **TailwindCSS** (for styling)
- **jsPDF** (for generating downloadable PDFs)
- **Backend API** (expected to be running at `http://localhost:8000`)

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm: https://nodejs.org

### 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend

2.Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3.Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
4.Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:5173


Backend Setup (Python FastAPI)
Note: Your backend code should expose an API endpoint to generate itineraries as per the contract described below.

5.Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```
6.Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
7.Install backend dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
8.Run the backend server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

🌐 API Contract
9.The frontend expects a backend API endpoint at:

```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate-itinerary
```
10.Request JSON Body:

{
  "story": "your travel story or idea here"
}
Response JSON Body:

{
  "itinerary": "Day 1: ...\nDay 2: ..."
}

📸 Example
Input:
I want to take my parents on a peaceful trip to the mountains.

Output:
Day 1: Arrive at Manali, check into a mountain resort.  
Day 2: Visit Solang Valley and enjoy cable car ride.  
Day 3: Relax and local market exploration before departure.
