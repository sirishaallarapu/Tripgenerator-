# Story-Based Trip Generator - Full Project Overview

---

## 1. Project Overview

The **Story-Based Trip Generator** is a web application that takes a user’s travel story or idea as input and returns a personalized travel itinerary generated by AI. The user can then download the itinerary as a PDF.

The project consists of two main parts:

- **Frontend:** React app for user interaction.
- **Backend:** API service that generates the itinerary from the user input.

---

## 2. Frontend

- **Purpose:** Provide UI for users to enter travel stories, display generated itineraries, and download them as PDFs.
- **How it works:**
  - User inputs a travel prompt.
  - Frontend sends this prompt to the backend via a **POST request**.
  - Receives itinerary from backend and displays it.
  - Allows downloading itinerary as PDF using `jsPDF`.

- **Tech stack:**
  - React
  - Vite (dev server and bundler)
  - TailwindCSS (styling)
  - jsPDF (PDF generation)

---

## 3. Backend

- **Purpose:** Receive user input, generate itinerary using AI or custom logic, and respond to frontend.
- **How it works:**
  - Accepts **POST** requests at `/api/generate-itinerary`.
  - Processes input (story prompt) and uses AI to generate itinerary.
  - Sends itinerary back as JSON.

- **Tech stack:**
  - Python (FastAPI or Flask)
  - AI language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT)
  - Runs on `localhost:8000`

---

## 4. Communication Flow

1. User opens frontend (`http://localhost:5173`).
2. Enters a travel story.
3. Frontend sends POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/generate-itinerary` with JSON payload:
   ```json
   { "story": "your travel story here" }

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm: https://nodejs.org

### 🔧 Setup Instructions

How to Run the Project
Backend Setup
Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

1. **Navigate to the frontend folder:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend

2.Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3.Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
4.Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:5173


Backend Setup (Python FastAPI)
Note: Your backend code should expose an API endpoint to generate itineraries as per the contract described below.

5.Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

7.Install backend dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
8.Run the backend server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

🌐 API Contract
9.The frontend expects a backend API endpoint at:

```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate-itinerary
```
10.Request JSON Body:

{
  "story": "your travel story or idea here"
}
Response JSON Body:

{
  "itinerary": "Day 1: ...\nDay 2: ..."
}

📸 Example
Input:
I want to take my parents on a peaceful trip to the mountains.

Output:
Day 1: Arrive at Manali, check into a mountain resort.  
Day 2: Visit Solang Valley and enjoy cable car ride.  
Day 3: Relax and local market exploration before departure.
